## Lesson 03: Loops, Data Processing and New Ideas

This class focused primarily on repetition structures — especially `for` and `while` loops applied to real-world scenarios. But what truly made this stage meaningful was the chance to go beyond logic and start working with data processing, particularly in the word count exercise.

Exercise 06 stood out for me. I cleaned and analyzed a text to count the frequency of each word. It was the first time I felt like I was doing something meaningful with data. Even though it was a simple script, it reminded me why I chose to transition into data.

This process reignited a sense of curiosity and excitement that I hadn’t felt in a long time. I realized that my passion isn’t just about learning Python or solving logical challenges. It’s about using these tools to solve real problems. I’ve always wanted to contribute to meaningful areas like healthcare and quality of life, especially due to personal experiences within my family. I’ll probably share more about that in a personal post soon.

After this class, I started sketching out a personal project: a tool for cleaning and exploring data. At first, I plan to focus on social media datasets, but eventually, I’d love to expand it into something bigger maybe a system to process and extract insights from medical records, test results, or patient histories.

This lesson taught me more than just code. It gave me vision. I’m truly grateful for that.

Feel free to explore the code and follow along with my journey.
