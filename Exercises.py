# Exercise 1: Data Quality Check
# You are analyzing a sales dataset and need to ensure that all records have positive values for quantity and price.
# Write a program that checks these fields and prints "Valid data" if both are positive, or "Invalid data" otherwise.

# Exercise 2: Sensor Data Classification
# Imagine you are working with IoT sensor data. The data includes temperature measurements.
# You need to classify each reading as 'Low', 'Normal', or 'High'. Given that:
# Temperature < 18째C is 'Low'
# Temperature >= 18째C and <= 26째C is 'Normal'
# Temperature > 26째C is 'High'

# Exercise 3: Log Filtering by Severity
# You are analyzing logs from an application and need to filter messages with severity 'ERROR'.
# Given a log record in dictionary format like log = {'timestamp': '2021-06-23 10:00:00', 'level': 'ERROR', 'message': 'Connection failed'},
# write a program that prints the message if the severity is 'ERROR'.

# Exercise 4: Input Data Validation
# Before processing user data in a recommendation system,

# Exercise 5: Transaction Anomaly Detection
# You are working on a fraud detection system and need to identify suspicious transactions.
# A transaction is considered suspicious if the amount is greater than R$ 10,000 or if it occurs outside business hours (before 9 am or after 6 pm).
# Given a transaction like transaction = {'value': 12000, 'hour': 20}, check if it is suspicious.
